# ðŸ”€ Sorter 

This is my first Powershell project.


It is a **Powershell** program that creates folders for each type of data and sorts other files into those folders (Sortierer.ps1).
I also have a second program that does everything backwards (Rueckgangig.ps1).

The code and other files can be found in the **master** branch.
