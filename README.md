# 🔀 Sorter

**Sorter** is my first project using **PowerShell**.

It includes a PowerShell script (`Sortierer.ps1`) that automatically creates folders based on file types and sorts files into them.  
There is also a second script (`Rueckgaengig.ps1`) that reverses the sorting process.

📁 **All code and files** can be found in the `**master**` branch.
